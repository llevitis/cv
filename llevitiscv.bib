    abstract = {Tau is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer’s disease, and animal models have suggested that tau spreads from cell to cell through neuronal
                connections, facilitated by $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$). We test this hypothesis in
                humans using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate tau spread, and
                compare these simulations to observed patterns measured using tau-PET in 312 
                individuals along Alzheimer’s disease continuum. Up to 70\% of the variance in 
                the overall spatial pattern of tau can be explained by our model. Surprisingly, 
                the ESM predicts the spatial patterns of tau irrespective of whether brain A$\beta$
                is present, but regions with greater A$\beta$ burden show greater tau than predicted
                by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of A$\beta$ in accelerating tau spread. 
                Altogether, our results provide evidence in humans that tau spreads through neuronal 
                communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by 
                the presence of brain A$\beta$.}
